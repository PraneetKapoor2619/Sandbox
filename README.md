# SANDBOX  
## A place where I put all the junk...  
  
Nobody every writes the perfect code in one single shot. Actually, one can write a perfect code in one single shot. However, every now and then I experiment, do little tests, and tinker with stuff which eventually gives rise to a project which everybody sees. This repository contains all those silly things I do, those "behind the screen moments" which nobody who gets to see the final result knows about.  
If I will make a separate repo. for all such little experiments, then there is going to a big mess. There is already a big mess, as one can see from my GitHub profile. And I do not wish to create any more. So, every other shit will happen in this repo, and only later, if deemed worthy will get known to the world. :-)
